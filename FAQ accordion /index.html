            <div class="answer">
                <p>JS stands for JavaScript, which is a high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that is
                    widely used for client-side scripting on the web. It is a scripting language that allows developers
                    to create dynamic and interactive web pages by adding behavior and interactivity to HTML and CSS. JS
                    is a versatile programming language that is used not only for web development but also for desktop
                    and mobile application development, game development, and even server-side programming.</p>

                <h3>Is it easy to learn HTML and CSS</h3>

                <svg width="15" height="10" viewBox='0 0 42 25'>
                    <path d="M3 3L21 21L39 3" stroke="white" stroke-width="7" stroke-linecap="round" />

            <div class="answer">
                <p>HTML and CSS are considered relatively easy to learn compared to other programming languages. They
                    have simple syntax and a relatively small set of rules to follow. Also, there are many resources
                    available online to help you learn, including tutorials, documentation, and forums. However, like
                    any new skill, it may take some time and practice to become proficient in HTML and CSS.

                <p>Web development is the process of creating websites or web applications. It involves a variety of
                    tasks, including web design, front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end development
                    (server-side scripting, database management), and server administration. The goal of web development
                    is to create user-friendly, responsive, and functional websites that provide value to the user. With
                    the growing importance of online presence for businesses and individuals, web development has become
                    an essential skill in today's digital world.</p>
